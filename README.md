# BountyArena <> ETHRome 

We are Web3 fanatics and developers, so why are we continuing to use a centralized platform to submit our project?

BountyArena is a platform to manage bounties (but everything similar like grants, requests for help or others can work). An entity (user or company) can publish a bounty and devs can apply and try to win the prize.

The bounty owner or the judges will launch a Snapshot proposal where the selected people (so in this case the judges) have to elect the best submission.

## Want to try it on your own?
1. Step1: clone the repo from GitHub
2. Step2: install the dependencies
```
    yarn
```
3. Step3: create the .env file. You will find a `.env.example` that you can copy and edit with your env variables
4. Step4: launch the application using dev mode:
```
    yarn dev
```
5. Step5: open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
