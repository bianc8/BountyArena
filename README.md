# BountyArena <> ETHRome

![BountyArena homepage](https://github.com/enricBiancott0/SNAKE/blob/main/public/images/bountyarena/screenshot.png?raw=true))

We are Web3 fanatics and developers, so why do we keep using a centralized platform to submit our project?

BountyArena is a platform to manage bounties (but everything similar like grants, requests for help or others can work). An entity (user or company) can publish a bounty and devs can apply and try to win the prize.

The bounty owner or the judges will launch a Snapshot proposal where the selected people (so in this case the judges) have to elect the best submission.

## Want to try it on your own?

3. Create the `.env` file:

NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_ID=26
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_SECRET=

```
4. Launch the website:
